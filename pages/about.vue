            I'm a determined software engineer from Croatia with a strong sense of good UX and design, meticulous attention to detail and a relentless focus on quality. Proficient in Vue, Nuxt, and full-stack TypeScript, I thrive on transforming ideas into polished products. My deep curiosity and strong passion for UX/UI design, awesome developer experience, clean code and open-source fuel my work.

          <p>Beyond code, I'm deeply passionate about Bitcoin, dedicating my time to advocating for preserving our privacy, fostering self-sovereignty, enhancing financial literacy, and cultivating a low time preference mindset. I am also very much into economics, psychology, art and literature.</p>
